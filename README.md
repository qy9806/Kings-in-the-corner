# Kings-in-the-corner
You have to keep placing the top card of the deck onto the board. (There's guide for how to move a card in the code comment)
Kings can only be placed on the corner. Once the board is full, removing the cards. 
You will when all of the face cards are in their places and the stock is empty.
